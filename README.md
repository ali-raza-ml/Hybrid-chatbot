# Hybrid-chatbot
This project is a simple yet powerful chatbot built using TensorFlow and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to understand user input and respond accordingly.
If the chatbot doesn't understand a question (i.e., it's not in the trained data), it falls back to using a Wikipedia API to generate intelligent responses â€” making this a Hybrid ChatBot.
